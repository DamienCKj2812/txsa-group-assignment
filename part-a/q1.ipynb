    "\n",
    "**Justification:**\n",
    "NLTK's `word_tokenize` is the most suitable operation for text analytics for several reasons:\n",
    "1. **Punctuation Handling:** The `split()` function keeps punctuation attached to words (e.g., `\"input.\"` or `\"advance;\"`), which is problematic for frequency analysis or vectorization.\n",
    "2. **Sophisticated Rules:** While basic regex (`\\w+`) removes punctuation, it can fail on hyphenated words (e.g., `\"open-class\"` becomes `\"open\"` and `\"class\"`). NLTK uses the Penn Treebank Tokenizer rules which are more linguistically sound.\n",
    "3. **Consistency:** NLTK correctly identifies punctuation marks as separate tokens, which allows for systematic filtering in the next stages of the pipeline."

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "Filtering stop words and punctuation is crucial in text analytics because:\n",
    "1. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Stop words (like \"the\", \"is\", \"at\") occur very frequently but carry little semantic value. Removing them significantly reduces the size of the feature space, improving computational efficiency.\n",
    "2. **Noise Reduction:** Punctuation and common functional words act as noise. By removing them, we focus on \"content-bearing\" words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) that define the actual meaning and context of the document.\n",
    "3. **Improved Signal-to-Noise Ratio:** For tasks like sentiment analysis or topic modeling, stop words can skew results. Removing them helps models capture the distinct linguistic signatures of different classes or topics more accurately."
